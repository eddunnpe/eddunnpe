I am a retired electrical engineer and active registered professional engineer. I am currently using Github as a means to learn more development of software and to use its source control methods to improve upon programs either already developed or that are current works in progress.
I have a website (www.ed-engineers.com) where I intend to place more completed projects for web access. Both desktop and web applications are expected to be hosted there.
My preferred development language is C#.  I have done some development in VB.Net in the past.  I am also interested in Python which I hope to pursue more diligently in the near future.  I should also mention that my initial introduction was to Fortran IV way back in the day, and did some BASIC programming in the early days of PC's.  I no longer have any interest in them, but I cut my teeth on them.  Now retired, I have more time to do modern programming that interests me.
